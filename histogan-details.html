              <h2>This is HRI page for the KALFA</h2>
              <p>
                Here, I will share my experience and Human Robot Interaction part of KALFA. Please see the github page for details of the KALFA.

        <p align="justify">
          Robots are cold metal co-workers for us. Yet, is this the destiny of them? We do not think so. Therefore, we look for ways to make 
          robot arms more pleasant and responsive companions for workers. In that direction, we found that <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3319502.3374829">[paper link]</a> some animation princibles
          taken from Disney increase socialability of the robot arms. Nevertheless, there was a tiny problem. Robot was not responsive to the human. 
          There was a Wizard of Oz who controls the experiments and decides what to do on the behalf of robot. 
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There, my task begins. We picked two promising animation princible namely gazing and breathing. Gazing is looking at somewhere. 
          However, robot arm has no eyes to look anywhere. Thus, we use it's gripper (the big black part at the tip of the robot). Gripper direction 
          manipulates the attention of the human partner of the robot. It makes human sense that robot is gazing at a point. As you guess, pointing 
          a point with gripper's direction is the gazing. 
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here comes the breathing. If you imagine how human looks when breathing you see his/her chest moves up and down slightly. 
          Unfortunately, robot again has no ability to stretch, unlike human. Yet, what it has is two long links (see shining long metals) close to the its base. 
          There we can use them to create imaginary volume like there exists a lung. Then, we stretch and relax that imaginary volume by 
          small ossilationary moves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I conducted an experiment with 57 participants where participants control the experiment flow. That means they 
          can interact with the robot as much as they desire. As an example, one interaction is doing mutual gaze. Mutual gaze 
          is the interaction when human looks at the robot and robot looks at the human. There are other interactions and also 
          breathing in the experiment. The paper was set off, stay tuned to see details. Nonetheless, since you read untill here,
          people likes gazing and breathing as a result. Moreover, the helmet and the bracelet at the photos are used to track 
          participants moves. If you wonder how I track and use them, I can say briefly I use motion capture cameras at the top.
